# JS30-8_HTMLCanvas
A HTML canvas for drawing on the page with the mouse

## HTML
* canvas element

## CSS
* hsl() colours

## Javascript
* using getContext("2d") on seleted canvas DOM element
* strokeStyle, lineJoin, lineCap, lineWidth properties
* globalCompositeOperation
* beginPath(), moveTo(), lineTo(), stroke() methods
* using offsetX and offsetY properties of event object
* mousemove, mousedown, mouseup, mouseout event types

### Ways to improve
* Have user select various options for drawing - canvas would not be whole page and there would be space to select options via form input
